## Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy

### For the trainer
Lees step 1 van thinking in react, toon de omringende lijnen en leg uit dat we beginnen met het maken van wat componenten puur bestaande uit layout en styling. So we will get a little familiar with JSX.

#### assignment ~~1~~ and 2: use branch --> master
We will start right away by creating a couple of functional components, the header and the footer. So for the header I basically want you to create a a folder named header, inside a file named Header.js and a css file named Header.css, move the header html from the app component to the Header.js and use the Header component in the App component. Same goes for the footer. Add a title and mabe a logo while your at it.

#### assignment 3: use branch --> 02-stateless-header-footer
After that, I want you to do the same for the menu on the left and the content on the right. Create a component for both of them and, add a search input field and a list with items and the content with some tekst and a button.

#### assignment 4: use branch --> 03-stateless-menu-content
Lastly for Step 1 of thinking in React, we will split up our menu into list and a search component component, which in turn will be used by the menu component. I Also want you to create a button component and use it in the content, so that we may re-use it later on.
