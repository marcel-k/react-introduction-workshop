## The assigments

In this folder you will see 5 files that represent 5 steps to creating a React application from scratch. The steps are described in the React documentation https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html .

Each step is broken down into smaller assignments. The solution of every assignment can be found in the next Git branch. You should work on every assignment from the previous branch unless instructed otherwise. So if your working on assignment 6, use the Git branch that starts with number 05.

The assignments folder also contain some instructions for the trainer (in dutch). You may of course read it but it is hopefully to cryptic to be of any use ;)

#### Note!: You will need to Git Stash youre changes before you can switch to the next branch.
