        "The first Fresh Friday EVER will offer you a head start on a creative approach to problem solving that should be the backbone of every (digital) product. Human-centered design (HCD) is all about making better products and fosters deep empathy with the humans that will engage with them. Therefore, it is a crucial mindset for every member in your product team: from business to backend development. We will touch upon the following subjects: what is it, why use it, who is it for, when to use it, methods, means and mindset and how to implement it. Enough to talk about!",
        "Frontend developers with at least two years of experience in frontend development in a team or in a professional organization, interested in creating products that are both meaningful and valuable to humans. This meetup is also intented for Clockwork frontend developers so the number of vacant spots is limited!",
        "Gain an understanding of Human Centered Design principles and learn how to apply the HCD mindset and methods in your next project.",

        "ECMAScript, the standard specification for JavaScript and other scripting languages, has added a lot of features since version 5 that are now supported by most browsers.

In this introduction, we will get our hands on the most important features since ES6 and use them with TypeScript.",

        "After this training you will have used the latest features of ECMAScript and combined them with TypeScript, and will be able to recognise these features in any codebase."

        "Angular has come a long way since its birth in 2010, it was very popular and very much used. It was perfect for small applications but not so great (performance wise) for large-scale applications. So in 2016 a brand new rewritten Angular version emerged. We now refer to this new version as simply Angular or 'Angular 2 and above'. The old version is now being referred as AngularJS.",
